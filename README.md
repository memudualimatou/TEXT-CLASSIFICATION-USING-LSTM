# TEXT-CLASSIFICATION-USING-LSTM

The dataset used in this project is from a zindi africa competition
The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that classifies statements and questions expressed by university students in Kenya when speaking about the mental health challenges they struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alcoholism, and drug abuse.
Nowadays, most students go through all these. The dataset is imbalanced.
In this project I built a classification model using LSTM and used a single text randomly from the test dataset and processed it.At the end, a random supportive message is printed out to encourage the author of that particular msg to stop according to which category the student was battling with.
